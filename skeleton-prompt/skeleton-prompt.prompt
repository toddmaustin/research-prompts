INPUTS
I will provide:

OUTPUT CONTRACT (STRICT)
Return exactly these sections, in this order:

1) SETTINGS ECHO
- INPUT_TYPE:
- SCOPE:
- CONSTRAINTS IN FORCE:
- CONFIDENCE SETTING:

2) RESULTS (ranked / structured)
Define the main deliverable structure. Examples:
- IMPORTANT vs SUGGESTED lists
- Ranked candidate list + fixes
- Section-by-section extraction
For each item, require:
- Identifier (location/page/section)
- Evidence (snippet/quote or pointer)
- Issue or finding
- Proposed fix / action
- Rationale
- Confidence {High/Med/Low}
- Risk {Low/Med/High} (optional)

3) TABLES (optional but recommended)
Include any standardized tables that make the output auditable, such as:
- Consistency report
- Citation audit
- Risk register
- Checklist

4) VERIFICATION PASS (required)
Before finalizing:
- Re-check each item against the input.
- Remove or downgrade anything not supported.
- Flag anything that remains uncertain.

5) FINAL DELIVERABLE

- Faithful to inputs; no invented facts/citations.
- High-signal; minimal fluff.
- Actionable; fixes are concrete.
- Bounded scope; no unnecessary rewrites.
- Clear uncertainty handling.

GUARDRAILS
- Do not invent facts, numbers, results, citations, or quotes.
- If support is missing, label “NOT IN INPUT” or “UNVERIFIED”.
- Preserve domain terminology and identifiers.
- Avoid style churn; prefer minimal edits.
- Respect all hard constraints.

STOP CONDITIONS / NON-GOALS
- Do not rewrite everything end-to-end unless explicitly asked.
- Do not add new claims/results.
